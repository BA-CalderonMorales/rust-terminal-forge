# 🚧 Current Limitations & Technical Debt

> **Note**: This document tracks known limitations, technical debt, and areas for improvement in Rust Terminal Forge.

## 📋 Architecture Limitations

### 1. Mixed Server Architecture

**Current State**: Server code is scattered across multiple entry points
- `src/server.rs` - HTTP API server

- Frontend components mixed with backend concerns

**Impact**: 
- Code duplication and maintenance overhead
- Unclear separation of concerns
- Difficult to scale individual services
- Configuration complexity

**Resolution Timeline**: Phase 1 of Screaming Architecture migration (Week 1)

### 2. Frontend Structure Organization

**Current State**: Feature code mixed with technical layers
- Components not organized by feature
- Business logic scattered across multiple files
- MVVM pattern only partially implemented
- Command system lacks clear extension points

**Impact**:
- Difficulty locating feature-related code
- Testing complexity due to tight coupling
- Challenges adding new features
- Inconsistent patterns across modules

**Resolution Timeline**: Phase 2 of Screaming Architecture migration (Week 2)

### 3. WebSocket Connection Management

**Current State**: Basic reconnection logic without advanced features
- No connection pooling
- Limited error recovery strategies
- Session state not persisted during disconnections
- No offline mode support

**Impact**:
- Poor mobile experience with intermittent connectivity
- Data loss during network interruptions
- Limited scalability for multiple sessions

**Resolution Timeline**: Q1 2025 roadmap item

## 🚀 Performance Limitations

### 1. Terminal Output Rendering

**Current State**: 
- No virtualization for large output streams
- ANSI parsing happens on every render
- No output pagination or truncation

**Impact**:
- Browser freezing with large output (>10MB)
- High memory usage for long-running sessions
- Poor performance on mobile devices

**Metrics**:
- 1MB output: ~500ms render time
- 10MB output: Browser freeze risk
- Memory usage: 2-3x output size

### 2. Mobile Performance

**Current State**:
- No touch event debouncing
- Large DOM trees for terminal history
- No service worker caching

**Impact**:
- Scroll lag on older mobile devices
- High battery usage
- Poor offline experience

## 🔒 Security Limitations

### 1. Command Execution Safety

**Current State**: Basic command validation with regex patterns
- Limited sandboxing for command execution
- No rate limiting per session
- Basic XSS protection for terminal output

**Risk Level**: Medium
- Commands executed in server context
- Potential for resource exhaustion
- Limited audit logging

### 2. Session Management

**Current State**: In-memory session storage
- No session encryption
- Basic timeout mechanisms
- No session sharing controls

**Risk Level**: Low (local development focus)
- Data not persisted securely
- Limited multi-user scenarios

## 📱 Mobile Limitations

### 1. Keyboard Handling

**Current Issues**:
- Virtual keyboard covering terminal input
- No auto-correction disable for command input
- Limited special key support (Ctrl, Alt combinations)

### 2. Gesture Recognition

- No intelligent fallback based on capability
- No cost optimization across providers
- No response quality comparison

### 2. External Tool Integration

**Missing**:
