# SPARC Execution Plan: Professional Terminal UI Redesign

## ðŸŽ¯ Executive Summary

Comprehensive plan to transform the terminal UI into an industry-leading interface using coordinated SPARC modes. Target: Exceed NvChad, VS Code, GitHub Codespaces, and GitBash standards.

## ðŸ“‹ Current Issues Analysis

### Critical UI Problems Identified:
1. **Overlapping UI Elements**: Theme switcher and other controls conflict
2. **Emoji Usage**: Unprofessional icons throughout the interface
3. **Console Errors**: Security warnings and technical debt
4. **Inconsistent Spacing**: Non-professional layout system
5. **Poor Responsive Design**: Breaks on various screen sizes
6. **Amateur Aesthetics**: Doesn't meet industry standards
